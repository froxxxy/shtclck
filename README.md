# shtclck

A shotclock app for pool players according to the Mosconi Cup rules:

> Each player has up to 30 seconds to complete each
> shot. The clock will start when the last moving ball
> on the table comes to rest. Failure to play a shot in
> the allocated time will result in loss of visit and cue
> ball in hand to the incoming player.
> After the break shot, a player can take a maximum
> of 60 seconds to appraise the table. The clock will
> start after the completion of the first shot in open
> play.
> Each Player (singles) or team (doubles) is allowed
> one 30-second extension per rack. This can be called
> at any time within the initial 30 seconds.

## how it works

- just give it a try. :) 
- most elements are clickable and some more actions are triggered on a "long press" event.
- it's intended for the device to be fullscreen and landscape oriented.
